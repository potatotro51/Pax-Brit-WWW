TAC_Leonard_Wood_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 10/9/1860\n\n§LLeonard Wood§! one of the young recruits of the American Confederation during the Nation's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Leonard Wood has been here since the very birth of the nation. Though under no circumstance is he the Father of it. One of the primary military leaders against the Northwestern Territories during the Seattle War, Wood would show a zealous amount of Patriotism:full heartedly defending his nation not only in battle, but also in word-valiantly defending his nation in all aspects of life. Though, unfortunately, the young Confederation would not endure this war. Following this, facing several secession movement and rebellions. The Confederation would techincally cease to exist, though through Leonard Wood's Coup d'etat and declaring marshall law, the ideals and dreams of the Confederation would live on through New Virginia. However, that was nearly two decades ago and Leonard Wood's age is showing, and many are wary about the rising force of the Radicals in the State of New Virginia. "

Before it was previously known as the American Confederation and it controlled much of the lands of the American West. However, less than two decades ago the nation's natural agressiveness would allow itself to become at war with the Northwest Pacific Territories over the Seattle area. The war would ultimately end in failure for the young American Nation, and would lead to several of its member states declaring independence-from Tabernacle to Freedonia, and would ultimately lead to the end of the Confederation.
